It does seem right from a physical point of view to say \"*the reflected ray is always present*\" since that all matter interacts with light, there is some incident energy will always be lost. It is also true that where the reflection coefficient will equal zero is at the boundary of two media with the exact same indices of refraction where it is specialy difficult to get two or more mediums of same refractive index for a wide range of wavelenghts. The task consisting in adapting these two media is called **matching**, to minimize the loses physics research is involved.\n",

On the basis of this atomic scale interaction, some energy will always be lost in the form of attenuation in reflections and refraction intensities. Nevertheless, at a macroscopic level the refraction index are good modelling tools. They can be employed directly into the Snell's law (refraction indexes). This change of intensity is the concern of the scattering parameters ($S_{11}$ and $S_{12}$ respectively)\n",
